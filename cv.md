### Briefly about myself:

I am currently working as a marketer, setting up contextual advertising in Yandex. Direct. I was interested in the development and I started looking through CS50 courses, a course from MIPT on Computer Science and algorithms, respectively. At the same time, I practiced using Chat-Gpt as a tutorial to figure out the basic syntax of python and did practice in this way. Now I would like to apply the knowledge I have gained and create a small application for my main job, so I am studying a course from rolling scopes!

### Code example:

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.
```
def remove_char(s):
    #your code here
    return s[1:-1]
```
